I have been thinking so much about Texas these past few weeks since Hurricane Harvey hit them so hard. My heart has gone out to my friends who are dealing with some major hardships as they try to rebuild their lives, homes and communities. It is has been utterly devastating.

One thing I know about Texas is that it is filled with some of the hardest working, loving, unselfish people I have ever met. They will come out stronger and better.  This Texas Blueberry Cobbler reminds me of a place we love and where we called home for 3 years.

I was searching for a cobbler that was reminiscent of what we ate in the bbq restaurants in Texas. I stumbled upon a recipe in one of my favorite cookbooks — The Best of America’s Test Kitchen and I played around with it. It was just like the cobbler we ate in Texas and now we can eat it here at home in AZ!

This Texas-Style Blueberry Cobbler has a buttery crust that everyone in our family was fighting over. It is full of vibrant blueberries, sugar, and lemon zest to bring out their fresh flavor.  The buttery crust is baked with a sprinkle of sugar on top to add a touch of sweetness and crunch. It is like a blueberry muffin and a cake came together and formed one heck of a cobbler.

It all starts off with butter. I mean….is there anything better? Butter is slowly melted in a glass baking dish in the oven.  A simple batter is made with butter, sugar, milk, flour, and baking powder.

Blueberries, sugar and lemon zest and all combined in a bowl. Sugar brings out the natural sugars in blueberries which creates some juices.  The batter is dolloped over the melted butter and then topped with the sugared blueberries. As the cobbler bakes, the batter rises above the blueberries and makes a heavenly topped crust.

This Texas-Style Blueberry Cobbler can be served warm with a big ‘ol dollop of vanilla bean ice cream. It is the quintessential summer dessert.

Frequently Asked Questions
1. Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?
Yes! You can absolutely use frozen blueberries. Thaw them briefly and pat them dry to remove excess moisture. Frozen berries may color the batter slightly more purple, but the taste will still be delicious.

2. What if I don’t have buttermilk?
Whole milk works perfectly fine. Buttermilk adds a tangier flavor, but you can make a quick substitute by mixing 1 tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice into 1 1/2 cups of regular milk and letting it sit for 5 minutes.

3. Can I use a smaller baking dish?
You can use an 8×8 or 9×9-inch dish, but the cobbler will be thicker and may take longer to bake. Keep a close eye on the oven and test the center for doneness.

4. What makes this ‘Texas-style’?
Texas-style cobblers often feature a cake-like batter poured over melted butter. As it bakes, the batter rises around the fruit, creating pockets of juicy fruit and a golden, buttery crust on top.

5. How can I tell when the cobbler is done?
Look for a nicely browned, crisp top around the edges, and test the center with a toothpick or knife to make sure the batter is fully cooked.
