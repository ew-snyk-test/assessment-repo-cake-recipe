## Ingredient List
1/4 cup butter
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 can (20 oz) pineapple slices in juice, drained, juice reserved
1 jar (6 oz) maraschino cherries without stems, drained
1 box Betty Crocker™ Super Moist™ Yellow Cake Mix
Vegetable oil and eggs called for on cake mix box
Preparation
Heat oven to 350°F (325°F for dark or nonstick pan). In 13x9-inch pan, melt butter in oven. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over butter. Arrange pineapple slices on brown sugar. Place cherry in center of each pineapple slice, and arrange remaining cherries around slices; press gently into brown sugar.
Add enough water to reserved pineapple juice to measure 1 cup. Make cake batter as directed on box, substituting pineapple juice mixture for the water. Pour batter over pineapple and cherries.
Bake 42 to 48 minutes (44 to 53 minutes for dark or nonstick pan) or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Immediately run knife around side of pan to loosen cake. Place heatproof serving plate upside down onto pan; turn plate and pan over. Leave pan over cake 5 minutes so brown sugar topping can drizzle over cake; remove pan. Cool 30 minutes. Serve warm or cool. Store covered in refrigerator.
Recipe Tips
Serve pineapple upside-down cake with sweetened whipped cream or an 8-oz container of frozen (thawed) whipped topping (3 cups), if desired. For 3 cups of sweetened whipped cream, in chilled medium bowl, beat 1 1/2 cups whipping cream and 2 tablespoons granulated sugar with electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form.
Worried about inverting the upside-down pineapple cake? You can do it! After placing serving plate upside-down over pan, grasp firmly and flip in one quick motion. Confidence makes all the difference.
Try adding dried spices to the brown sugar and butter mixture for a new flavor twist.
