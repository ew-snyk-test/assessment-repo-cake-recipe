I always look forward to summer and cherry season. While I love eating fresh cherries just as they are, I also love baking with them!

This cherry ricotta cake combines cherries and ricotta to make one of the moistest cakes ever. If you're looking for more summer cakes, definitely check out this olive oil cake with prosecco strawberries too!

What is amazing about this cake is it's so versatile - it makes a great breakfast or brunch cake because it's not overly sweet, a great afternoon snack with coffee, and of course, it's the perfect light dessert after a big meal. You really can't go wrong with it!

Top tips:
You can use different fruit other than cherries in this cake. Raspberries, strawberries, or blueberries would work well.
You can also add the zest of one lemon to the batter for a subtle lemon flavor!
How to store it and freeze:
The cake can be stored at room temperature for up to two days . Make sure it is well wrapped or stored in an airtight container. If you're keeping it any longer, it should be refrigerated, and will last a few more days in the fridge.
This cake freezes very well. Wrap it in plastic wrap or place it in an airtight container or freezer bag. It can be frozen for up to 3 months.
When thawing, you can thaw it in the fridge overnight.
